# CPP_ImageAnnotation
Second year university project using CPP (Qt) to create an image annotation application. This was intended for use in Machine Learning to allow a given AI the ability to learn objects by studying a set of images which are annotated to indicate areas of interest.

The demonstration of this is available at: https://youtu.be/9qrxwFJ4zW0
